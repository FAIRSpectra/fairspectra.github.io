Ideally a file format should be self-describing. Some existing data file formats for SIMS include...

### Spectrum-focussed
- JCAMP-DX
- SPC (accommodates multiple spectra)
- VAMAS (ISO 14976:1998 with ISO 22048:2004)

### Hyperspectral image-focussed
- imzML

### Other formats that could be explored include
- NetCDF
- HDF5
- Apache Arrow
- Apache Parquet
- Apache Feather


## Open questions
- *Which software packages can **write** these formats?*
- *Which software packages can **read** these formats?*
