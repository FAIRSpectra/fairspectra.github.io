***Enabling the FAIRification of Spectroscopy and Spectrometry*** 
{: style="text-align: center"}

There is now a growing requirement for data acquired on projects supported by national funding programmes to be shared openly. This includes organisations such as UKRI, ERC, Horizon, NIH, NSF, Wellcome, DFG etc.

Sharing data requires that the files must be readable by others and can be understood in terms of their content. **FAIRSpectra** aims to tackle issues with interoperability and reusability, as defined by the [FAIR Guiding Principles](/definitions/fair-principles/). This has been broken down into two areas of activity: [open file formats](/resources/) and [metadata vocabulary](/definitions/metadata).

FAIRSpectraâ€™s aim is to open a discussion about what the chemical analysis field requires in terms of file format support, and specifcally the imaging modalities of spectroscopy and spectrometry. As such **we invite all interested parties to get involved**, share expertise, and become part of the solution.

## Please complete our survey
We have put together a short survey on our attitudes to data sharing and how we collect information about our experiments. This survey is anonymous, but there is an option to leave your contact details if you wish. The survey can be found here: [https://forms.gle/KZMWcChvRoxzg3CV9](https://forms.gle/KZMWcChvRoxzg3CV9).

## Join the conversation!
We are using the Discord platform to discuss all aspects of the FAIRSpectra project. Use this link to join the FAIRSpectra workspace: [https://discord.gg/xdm3pJxR](https://discord.gg/xdm3pJxR).
