This year, the [North American SIMS Workshop](https://www.na-sims.org/home/sims-workshop) travels to the California State University Northridge (CSUN) in Northridge California, with co-chairs [Michael J. Eller](https://www.eller.prof/) and [Christine Mahoney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christine-mahoney-75023b12/). The SIMS Workshop has a long history covering the entirety of the SIMS technique, and often has a significant commercial audience. 

At this year’s event, FAIRSpectra have been invited to run a workshop that Alex Henderson will host. The workshop will cover metadata for SIMS, and software priorities for the free, open-source toolkit discussed at the IUVSTA 101 meeting in 2024. 

Alex will also present a poster on “International Initiatives Relating to SIMS”. This covers our FAIRSpectra Initiative, and includes activities in ISO, VAMAS, FAIRmat and the various NDFI communities. Probably too much for a poster, but there will be time for discussion at the meeting to explore opportunities and challenges in SIMS data management.  

A PDF of the poster can be found at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15600950](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15600950), and below are links mentioned in the text.
