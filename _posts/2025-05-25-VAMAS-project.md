[VAMAS](https://www.vamas.org/), the Versailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards is an international organisation helping to develop harmonized data sharing, amongst other activities.

Currently running is project TWA2/A45 on a **Comprehensive file format for the measurement and analysis of surface chemical analysis data** developed by a Japanese consortium led by Professor Takuo Yasunaga. A flyer for this can be found [here](https://www.vamas.org/twa2/documents/vamas_twa2_p_a45_data_file_format.pdf). 

We encourage everyone to engage with this project so that the project team can benefit from a range of experience and perspectives. 

Please contact Prof. Takuo Yasunaga [yasunaga@phys.kyutech.ac.jp](yasunaga@phys.kyutech.ac.jp) or Alex Henderson [alex.henderson@manchester.ac.uk](alex.henderson@manchester.ac.uk), if you would like more information.
