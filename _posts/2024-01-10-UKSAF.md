Those in the UK surface analysis community will be well aware of the UK Surface Analysis Users Forum (UKSAF, [https://www.uksaf.net/](https://www.uksaf.net/)) who organise 1-2 day meetings twice a year. At the Winter meeting, held 10 January, the organisers graciously offered an exhibition booth for FAIRSpectra. 

We had a few visitors to the booth and interesting conversations throughout the event. Some topics discussed included:

- The necessity for a new file format for SIMS to allow third-parties to develop data analysis solutions. This would take pressure off the vendors to supply advanced methods in their instrument software, allowing then to concentrate on their 'core business'. 

- New modalities are not covered by existing standard file formats, for example [ISO 14976](/resources/iso-14976/).

- The OrbiSIMS instrument can capture data using two types of detector. These data should be recorded together. 

At this meeting we decided to open out the requirements question to the delegates. This was in the form of a paper document, but will become an online record in the coming weeks, so everyone can record their thoughts. 

Don't forget, if you have any opinions or suggestions, please join our discussion forum at [http://tiny.cc/join-FAIRSpectra](http://tiny.cc/join-FAIRSpectra) or email Alex Henderson at [alex.henderson@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:alex.henderson@manchester.ac.uk)

The next UKSAF meeting will be held at Surrey University in July. Check out their [website](https://www.uksaf.net/) for more details.
