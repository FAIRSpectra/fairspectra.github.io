Metadata is loosely defined as data about data. This covers everything from:

- sample origin, 
- sample pre-treatment, 
- data acquisition, 
- data pre-processing, 
- data analysis. 

In addition, the order of steps in these general categories is important. 

Each of these steps in the analysis pipeline has parameters that can influence the outcome and should be recorded.
