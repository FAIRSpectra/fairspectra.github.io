The [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/) describe things to consider when making scholarly data available. These are broken down into four interrelated topics: Data and metadata should be **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable. 

Findability and Accessibility relate to identifiers such as a DOI, and appropriate licencing terms. Interoperability and Reusability recommend that data are stored in a manner that is readable by all, and that information about the data (the metadata) is described in enough detail to be understood by both humans and machines.
